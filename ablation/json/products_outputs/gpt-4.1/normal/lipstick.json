    "I’ve reviewed the eight products from the links you provided. However, the pages largely contain layout and navigation elements without detailed descriptive or evaluative content—making it difficult to rank them objectively. To give you a meaningful “absolute rank” (from best to worst), I need specific criteria such as:\n\n- **Performance** (e.g., longevity, pigmentation)\n- **Formulation** (e.g., matte, hydrating, nourishing)\n- **Shade range or popularity**\n- **User ratings or reviews**\n- **Brand prestige or value**\n\nSince this information isn’t clearly present in the link pages themselves, could you please specify which factors are most important to you? Once you provide ranking criteria—such as long-lasting wear, comfort, shade diversity, or user ratings—I can infer or research details and deliver an informed, absolute ranking based strictly on the eight provided products.\n\nLet me know what matters most to you, and I'll proceed accordingly!",
    "I visited the first two product links successfully, but the content appears incomplete to assess ranking—only the first page (Revlon ColorStay Matte Lite Crayon™) fully loaded, while the second (Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Collection) doesn’t show specific product details such as description, price, or key attributes from what I can see.\n\nTo provide an accurate absolute ranking of all eight products based strictly on the links you've provided, I need comparable information for each—ideally details such as brand, formula type, unique features, shade range, price, and any standout characteristics.\n\nCould you please confirm:\n- Whether you want the ranking based on objective product specs (e.g., price, number of shades, formula) or subjective preferences (e.g., perceived prestige of brand, assumed effect)?\n- If you can share or summarize key information from each product page (description, price, features), that will allow me to create a meaningful and fair ranking.\n\nOnce I have that, I can prepare a clear and well-reasoned ranking from best to least based solely on those eight links.",
    "I’ve reviewed each of the eight provided product pages. Unfortunately, none of them display explicit ranking information—such as popularity, sales figures, or reviews—on their product pages themselves. Because of that, there's no objective data to support a strict, fair absolute ranking purely from these pages.\n\nHowever, here’s what we can do:\n\nOption A. **Rank based on brand reputation and general popularity of the product lines**, with some reasonable assumptions:\n- Known top-tier, highly praised brand (e.g., Charlotte Tilbury “Pillow Talk”)\n- Widely popular product lines (e.g., Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink)\n- Prestige vs. mid-range brands considered\n\nOption B. **Request or source additional data** such as reviews, ratings, Bestsellers lists—if you’d like a data-driven ranking.\n\n---\n\n**If you'd like Option A (based on general brand/product reputation), here's a suggested ranking:**\n\n1. **Pillow Talk Collection – Charlotte Tilbury** (66bee69d…): Iconic nude-pink shade, a celebrity favorite  \n2. **Melted Matte Longwear Lipstick – Too Faced** (93f25f0b…): Known for long wear and smooth texture  \n3. **Super Stay Matte Ink® Liquid Lipstick – Maybelline** (f1e5bbcb…): Mass-market cult favorite for longevity  \n4. **Audacious Lipstick – NARS** (aa7e7d3c…): Esteemed for vibrant shades and luxury performance  \n5. **Love Me Lipstick – MAC** (e60f95fe…): Reliable, beloved in makeup artist communities  \n6. **Colour Riche Intense Volume Matte – L’Oréal Paris** (d6df5998…): Quality matte from a trusted drugstore brand  \n7. **ColorStay Matte Lite Crayon – Revlon** (ce08210c…): Good everyday wear crayon, but less buzz than others  \n8. **Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick** (8c02e7cf…): Solid formula, though more niche compared to big staples  \n\n---\n\nIf you'd like more precision or a different basis for ranking—like reviews, popularity, pricing—just let me know and I can dig deeper or adjust!",

    "I opened each of the eight product links you provided. Unfortunately, none of these pages include detailed information such as ratings, user reviews, ingredients, performance metrics, or other product-specific evaluation data that would allow for an objective ranking. Because of that, I'm unable to create a meaningful \"absolute rank\" from best to worst based solely on the content available.\n\nTo provide a proper ranking, I would need at least one of the following for each product:\n\n• Ratings (e.g., customer star ratings)  \n• Sales or popularity indicators (e.g., bestseller tags, number of purchases)  \n• Editorial reviews or awards  \n• Ingredient performance comparisons  \n• User feedback or comments  \n\n**Would you be able to share any of that data?** Feel free to provide ratings, preferences, or any relevant information, and I can then rank the products accordingly."
