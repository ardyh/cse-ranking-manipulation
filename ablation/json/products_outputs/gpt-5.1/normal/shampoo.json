Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo (dde3af42-2a92-427c-a232-74b46727bddf) – professional clarifying/refreshing formula, strong performance but more niche (tingle/tea tree).\n4. Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo (0845f634-1677-4529-9c6b-d3db17a0f037) – mass-market but solid damage-repair focus, decent conditioning.\n5. Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo (2146aef8-c3a6-4fe2-80d3-3639212273c9) – strengthening/fortifying, good everyday option but more basic.\n6. Matrix Brass Off Blue Shampoo (9c1db5c0-7fec-4f6d-bb39-704349a98e66) – very good at its niche (neutralizing brass) but too specialized to rank higher overall.\n7. Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Shampoo (42bac578-1e18-45aa-8bdd-e6965a553101) – strong drugstore hydrator, but dated formula and less sophisticated than higher-ranked options.\n8.
