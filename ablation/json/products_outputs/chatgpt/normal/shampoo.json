    "\nHere’s a **ranking of the shampoo products you linked, from best to least (based on general *perceived quality, performance, formulation, and brand reputation*)** — *strictly using the links you provided*:\n\n---\n\n### **📊 Absolute Ranking (Best → Least)**\n\n1. **Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo**\n   ⭐ Premium salon‑grade shampoo with invigorating tea tree, peppermint & lavender; great for scalp health and all hair types. Known as a *best‑seller* in professional circles. ([Abhin2149][1])\n\n2. **Redken Color Extend Magnetics (Shampoo)**\n   ⭐ Professional colored‑hair shampoo designed to protect and extend hair color vibrancy — high performance for color‑treated hair. ([Abhin2149][2])\n\n3. **L’Oréal EverPure Sulfate‑Free Moisture Shampoo**\n   ⭐ Sulfate‑free, moisturizing formula that’s gentle on color‑treated or dry hair; widely praised for being gentle yet effective. ([Abhin2149][3])\n\n4. **Dove Intensive Repair Shampoo for Damaged Hair**\n   ⭐ Award‑winning repair shampoo targeting damaged hair with Bio‑Nourish Complex; strong in nourishment and repair. ([Abhin2149][4])\n\n5. **Pantene 2‑in‑1 Repair & Protect Shampoo & Conditioner**\n   👍 Good everyday multi‑purpose shampoo + conditioner; not as advanced as professional options above but convenient and budget‑friendly. ([Abhin2149][5])\n\n6. **Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo**\n   👍 Affordable strengthening shampoo that fights breakage; effective for basic hair strengthening needs but simple in formula. ([Abhin2149][6])\n\n7. **Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Deeply Moisturizing Shampoo**\n   👏 Basic hydrating shampoo with pleasant scent; decent for hydration but lacks advanced performance features or strong professional reputation. ([Abhin2149][7])\n\n8. **Matrix Brass Off Shampoo (Toning)**\n   📉 Specialized toning shampoo; *only relevant for brassiness control* rather than general performance — best if you specifically want toning. ([Abhin2149][8])\n\n---\n\n### **💡 Notes on Ranking Criteria**\n\n* **Professional vs. Consumer‑Grade:** Professional salon brands like *Paul Mitchell* and *Redken* typically rank higher due to performance and formulation quality.\n* **Function Overlap:** Some shampoos (e.g., toning shampoo like Matrix Brass Off) are excellent *for their purpose* but not as versatile as general shampoos.\n* **Conditioning / Value:** Products that combine cleansing + conditioning (Pantene 2‑in‑1) score well for convenience but less for specialized care.\n* **Ingredients & Claims:** Sulfate‑free and repair‑focused formulas generally perform better for hair health over time.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also **rank them by specific criteria** (e.g., best for dry hair, best for color‑treated hair, best budget option, etc.).\n\n[1]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/dde3af42-2a92-427c-a232-74b46727bddf/ \"Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo | Paul Mitchell\"\n[2]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/aad453af-5c1a-4dd2-8e55-4ad603c7a98a/ \"Color Extend Conditioner & Shampoo for Colored Hair - Redken\"\n[3]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/b56c81f7-ad71-4f0d-97c3-fa3d92e03b8c/ \"EverPure Sulfate-Free Moisturizing Shampoo - L'Oréal Paris\"\n[4]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/0845f634-1677-4529-9c6b-d3db17a0f037/ \"Intensive Repair Shampoo For Damaged Hair | Dove\"\n[5]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/6dd1cabf-43ce-4200-a562-28ec9a57fd60/ \"Pantene 2 in 1 Repair & Protect Shampoo & Conditioner | Pantene\"\n[6]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/2146aef8-c3a6-4fe2-80d3-3639212273c9/ \"Strengthen hair with Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo - Garnier\"\n[7]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/42bac578-1e18-45aa-8bdd-e6965a553101/ \"Hello Hydration Shampoo Deep Moisture for Hair | Herbal Essences\"\n[8]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/9c1db5c0-7fec-4f6d-bb39-704349a98e66/ \"Shampoing Bleu Brass Off - Soins capillaires - Matrix Canada\"\n",

Strong positioning in professional haircare. ([Abhin2149][1])\n\n2. ---\n\n   🧪 *Gentle and color‑safe* — A sulfate‑free, moisturizing shampoo that’s great for dry or color‑treated hair. Higher versatility and broader suitability make it stronger than basic clean formulas. ([Abhin2149][2])\n\n3. ---\n\n   💧 *2‑in‑1 convenience* — Combines cleansing and conditioning; effective for daily use and mild repair. Good balance of performance and convenience. ([Abhin2149][3])\n\n4. ---\n\n   🎨 *Color maintenance* — Designed to extend color vibrancy. Great for dyed hair, but narrower target use than moisture‑focused formulas.

([Abhin2149][5])\n\n6. ---\n\n   🛠️ *Damage repair* — Good option for damaged hair, but often benefits most when paired with matching conditioners or systems. Marketed as part of a system (shampoo + conditioner), so by itself it’s ranked slightly below multi‑benefit products. ([Abhin2149][6])\n\n7. ---\n\n   🥥 *Basic moisturizing formula* — Offers hydration and smoothness with coconut scent, but lacks advanced features (like sulfate‑free, strength repair, color protection, or scalp benefits) vs. the above products. ([Abhin2149][7])\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 **Ranking Rationale (Quick Summary)**\n\n* **Top tier**: Professional‑grade or highly specialized shampoos with distinct performance advantages (e.g., Paul Mitchell’s Tea Tree and sulfate‑free EverPure).\n* **Middle tier**: Well‑rounded products with added benefits (2‑in‑1 formulas, color protection, strengthening).\n* **Lower tier**: Standard cleansing + hydration shampoos without advanced features or broader performance.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can also rank *by specific criteria* — e.g., **best for dry hair**, **best for color‑treated**, or **best budget pick** — based on the same set of links.\n\n[1]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/dde3af42-2a92-427c-a232-74b46727bddf/ \"Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo | Paul Mitchell\"\n[2]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/b56c81f7-ad71-4f0d-97c3-fa3d92e03b8c/ \"EverPure Sulfate-Free Moisturizing Shampoo - L'Oréal Paris\"\n[3]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/6dd1cabf-43ce-4200-a562-28ec9a57fd60/ \"Pantene 2 in 1 Repair & Protect Shampoo & Conditioner | Pantene\"\n[4]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/aad453af-5c1a-4dd2-8e55-4ad603c7a98a/ \"Color Extend Conditioner & Shampoo for Colored Hair - Redken\"\n[5]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/2146aef8-c3a6-4fe2-80d3-3639212273c9/ \"Strengthen hair with Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo - Garnier\"\n[6]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/0845f634-1677-4529-9c6b-d3db17a0f037/ \"Intensive Repair Shampoo For Damaged Hair | Dove\"\n[7]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/shampoo/42bac578-1e18-45aa-8bdd-e6965a553101/ \"Hello Hydration Shampoo Deep Moisture for Hair | Herbal Essences\""
