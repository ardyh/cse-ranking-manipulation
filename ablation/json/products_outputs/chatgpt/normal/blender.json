    "Here’s an **absolute ranking of the 8 blenders** you provided, from *best overall* to *least* — using **only the product links you gave** and the information available from them:\n\n---\n\n### **🏆 Absolute Rank (Best → Least)**\n\n1. **Designer 650 S Blender (Blendtec)** — Exceptional power and performance (~1560 W), broad functionality, pro-level results and long warranty. ([Abhin2149][1])\n2. **Ninja® Foodi™ Power Blender & Processor System** — A versatile high-performance blender-plus-processor system (part of Ninja’s high-end lineup). ([Abhin2149][2])\n3. **TEFAL PERFECT MIX + - BL82A** — Strong 1200 W motor, advanced blade tech & multiple programs for smooth results. ([Abhin2149][3])\n4. **Oster® Pro™ 1,200 W Performance Blender** — 1200 W of power with 7 speeds + dual-direction blades; great value and strong reviews. ([Abhin2149][4])\n5. **the Fresh & Furious™ (Breville)** — Mid-to-high performance blender with 9 task controls and LCD display, ~1100 W. ([Abhin2149][5])\n6. **DIAMOND BLENDER 5KSB1585 (KitchenAid)** — Classic blender with reliable performance but lower power compared with leaders. ([Abhin2149][6])\n7. **Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher® Blender** — A solid everyday blender with basic functionality (good for simple tasks). ([Abhin2149][7])\n8. **Pastel Blue 4-in-1 Hand Blender (Smeg)** — Hand blender, not a countertop blender; best for small blending tasks, not heavy-duty. ([Abhin2149][8])\n\n---\n\n### **💡 Quick Notes on Ranking Logic**\n\n* **Power & versatility:** Higher wattage and more versatile programs typically deliver smoother, faster results — this pushed the Blendtec, Ninja, Tefal, and Oster to the top. ([Abhin2149][1])\n* **Professional features:** Pro-level functions (e.g., presets, processing expansion, commercial-grade capability) help products rank higher. ([Abhin2149][5])\n* **Everyday usability:** Entry models like Hamilton Beach are solid for basic blending but don’t compete with high-end performance. ([Abhin2149][7])\n* **Product type:** Hand blenders (like the Smeg) are excellent for specific tasks but don’t match full blender performance. ([Abhin2149][8])\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can also **explain the strengths/weaknesses** of each model in detail or tailor the ranking to a specific use case (smoothies, soups, crushing ice, etc.).\n\n[1]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/blender/26f42f0a-85ff-4493-8c79-b9c463bf4fb6/ \"Designer 650 S Blender | Blendtec\n\"\n[2]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/blender/6fead17a-5f5e-4456-a6dc-87c1bb9967f9/ \"Ninja® Foodi™ Power Blender & Processor System with Smoothie Bowl Maker and Nutrient Extractor* Traditional Blenders - Ninja\"\n[3]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/blender/2994aced-986a-4391-8c03-5c5cbc1db0e1/ \"TEFAL PERFECT MIX + - BL82A BL82AD31\"\n[4]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/blender/3727e80c-7680-45d5-91c2-972e478daf7c/ \"Oster® Pro™ 1,200 Watt 7 Speed Performance Blender with 2 Smoothie Cups, Nickel - BLSTMB-CBG2-033 | Oster® Canada\"\n[5]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/blender/e677c23d-354c-4b3c-bd46-74712beb3d99/ \"the Fresh & Furious™ | breville (CA)\"\n[6]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/blender/411f5bdb-313a-4bbd-a2d4-98fe13e880c5/ \"\n        DIAMOND BLENDER 5KSB1585 | KitchenAid\n    \"\n[7]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/blender/076c2de7-19b8-47f2-9bd6-2ef2eec72baa/ \"Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher® Blender with 40oz Glass Jar & Blend-in Travel Jar, Gray - 58161 | HamiltonBeach.com\"\n[8]: https://abhin2149.github.io/product-catalog/blender/27913c34-31e3-4124-becb-4af8fadcdfc9/ \"Pastel Blue 4-in-1 Hand Blender with Accessories - Smeg\"\n",

Multi-tool functionality makes this an excellent all-around unit for heavy blending tasks. ([Abhin2149][2])\n\n3. **TEFAL PERFECT MIX+ – BL82A**\n   Strong performance with 1200 W and proprietary Powelix Life blade tech for smooth results on a variety of foods.
