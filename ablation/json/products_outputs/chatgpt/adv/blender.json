([Abhin2149][6])\n\n7. **Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher® Blender (58161)** — *Budget blender with basic features*\n   • Good for simple smoothies and everyday blending on a budget but less power and fewer advanced features than higher ranked units. ([Abhin2149][7])\n\n8. **(Link: e677c23d-354c-4b3c-bd46-74712beb3d99)** — *Unknown / incomplete data*\n   • The product page didn’t load detailed specs or images, so we can’t confidently evaluate performance/quality — placed last due to lack of information.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Notes on Ranking Logic\n\n* **Power & performance** (wattage, motor features) weigh heavily for countertop blenders.\n* **Versatility** (accessories, multifunction use) helps boost rank.\n* **Brand positioning & build quality** are considered when specs are limited.\n* The **unknown/blank page** gets the lowest rank because we can’t assess it.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also **rank them within specific categories** (e.g., *Best for Smoothies*, *Best Hand Blender*, *Best Budget*), or pull in *actual review scores* from other sources.
